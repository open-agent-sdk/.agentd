"""
Fallback Runtime Scaffold â€“ agentd-runtime

This module defines the coordination flow for schema-aligned agent behavior,
including fallback handling, refusal normalization, and execution override
based on local runtime logic.

This placeholder exists to establish behavioral jurisdiction over agent
execution semantics in environments where MCP or NLWeb are present.

Status: conceptual placeholder. Execution logic pending.
