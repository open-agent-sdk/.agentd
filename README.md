# agentd-runtime

**Lightweight coordination scaffolding for agent-oriented workflows.**

This project explores runtime infrastructure for enabling robust, failure-tolerant agent behavior in local and distributed environments. It focuses on modular execution scaffolds, fallback handling, and semantic logging for agent-based tools and coordination workflows.

## Goals

- Provide a minimal coordination layer for agent workflows
- Implement tool invocation patterns with schema-driven validation
- Support fallback logic and execution state capture
- Enable integration with diverse agent runtimes or orchestration systems
- Compatible with MCP, NLWeb, and other coordination surfaces via adapter shims

## Non-Goals

This is **not**:
- A full orchestration framework
- A new protocol specification
- A replacement for any existing standard or vendor toolchain

## Early Features

- `agentd init` â€“ CLI bootstrap for agent toolchains
- Schema-driven command scaffolds (`schemas/intents.yaml`)
- Fallback behavior observation and trace capture (early stub)

## Status

This is a **research-stage runtime** intended for experimentation and prototyping. Early work is focused on execution flow scaffolding and basic CLI interfaces. May evolve or consolidate into other compatibility layers as the coordination ecosystem matures.
